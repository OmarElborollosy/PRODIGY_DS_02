## Overview

The Titanic Dataset Analysis project explores the famous Titanic passenger data. By analyzing this dataset, we gain insights into passenger demographics, survival rates, and other interesting patterns. Whether you're a data enthusiast, a history buff, or just curious, this project offers a fascinating glimpse into the past.

## Introduction

The sinking of the RMS Titanic in 1912 remains one of the most tragic maritime disasters in history. This project aims to analyze the Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers, their socio-economic status, and survival outcomes. By exploring this data, we can uncover valuable insights and pay homage to the lives lost.

## Dataset

- The Titanic dataset includes the following columns:
    - `PassengerId`: Unique identifier for each passenger
    - `Survived`: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
    - `Pclass`: Passenger class (1 = First class, 2 = Second class, 3 = Third class)
    - `Name`: Passenger's name
    - `Sex`: Gender
    - `Age`: Age in years
    - `SibSp`: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
    - `Parch`: Number of parents/children aboard
    - `Ticket`: Ticket number
    - `Fare`: Fare paid
    - `Cabin`: Cabin number
    - `Embarked`: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

## Project Steps

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**:
   - Read the Titanic dataset.
   - Explore basic statistics and data types.
   - Check for missing values.

2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values (e.g., fill missing ages with mean age).
   - Drop irrelevant columns (e.g., 'Cabin').
   - Convert data types (e.g., 'Survived' to boolean).

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualize passenger demographics (e.g., age, gender, class).
   - Investigate survival patterns (e.g., survival rates by class, gender).

4. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - Calculate correlations between relevant features (e.g., age and class).

## Usage

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install necessary libraries (e.g., Pandas, Matplotlib).
3. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script to reproduce the analysis.

## Limitations

- This analysis focuses on descriptive statistics and exploratory tasks.
- Predictive modeling (e.g., machine learning algorithms) is not included.

## Future Enhancements

- Explore additional features (e.g., passenger titles, family relationships).
- Investigate survival patterns based on socio-economic factors.
